## Do you want to ask a community?

Many people ask on forums (including Reddit) which mac they should get. But most of them never mention what they are 
going to use it for. If you are planning to ask, make sure to start with a description of what you plan to do with 
this Mac. Are you a gamer, software developer, designer, or just planning to use it for web browsing?

## Do you really need a Mac?

Let's start from the beginning. Do you really need a Mac? What are you using right now? What are you planning 
to use it for? Macs aren't cheap. Even if you get the cheapest Mac Mini for `$699`, you still have to purchase 
a monitor, keyboard, mouse, which can add up to `$1000`. The cheapest laptop, MacBook Air, starts at around `$1,000`. 
So it goes back to the same question, how are you planning to use it? 

### Mac or iPad

If the main reason for you to purchase a Mac to browse the Internet, watch movies, occasionally play games, edit 
some photos, and create videos for Instagram, you can do all of it with your iPhone or Android. If you need to 
have a larger screen, have you considered purchasing an iPad? The cheapest iPad starts at around `$300`. You can 
get a keyboard and an Apple Pencil for it, with that you can draw and make handwriting notes. It is also really 
lightweight, easy to carry, and has great battery life. Apple Pencil costs around `$100`. You can get an official 
Apple Keyboard for around `$100`, or buy something cheap from Amazon for `$30`.

If you are a software developer or studying to be one, that is not an option. People have tried a lot to use an 
iPad for software development. It is possible, but not easy.

### Mac or Windows

I said that Macs aren't cheap. Now I am going to say the opposite. Macs aren't that expensive. Many people compare 
Mac to Windows laptops or desktops, which have similar configurations for half of the price. Disk space can be 
similar 512Gb, and RAM and CPU, but there are always caveats. Disks can have different speeds. It can be NVME SSD 
with 5Gb/s or regular SSD with speeds up to 500Mb/s, or it could be an HDD with speeds just up to 150Mb/s (that is 
a difference in 33 times). I will talk more about the Disk speed later.

The same can be about the CPU, RAM speeds, and the most important, a screen.

Most people buy Macs for quality. They have a great retina display (a higher number of pixels per inch, so it 
is hard to actually see the pixels). Those displays are more expensive. Most of the Windows laptops don't have 
Retina (or High DPI) displays. That is usually why they cost less. If you don't see the difference between a 
non-Retina display and a Retina display, consider that when you choose. Apple does not sell any non-Retina 
laptops anymore.

Windows laptops or desktops are also great for gaming. You can find some ways to play games on Macs, and I will 
talk about that later, but the collection is always limited, and there is always some additional steps you 
might need to do.

If you are still thinking between Windows or Mac and don't want to spend too much money, get a Windows laptop. 
If you plan to play many games, and most AAA games, get a Windows laptop. You can get a decent Windows laptop 
for about $1,000 with a discrete graphics card, which you can use to play some AAA games on high settings. 
It will be a little heavy, not easy to carry, not the best battery life, but it will be performant enough 
and will do the job for you.

## Used or new?

If you are not looking specifically for some latest and greatest features, you can consider buying a used Mac. 
Keep in mind that Macs can translate to vintage or obsolete (discontinued more than 7 years ago) statuses (see 
[Obtaining service for your Apple product after an expired warranty](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201624)).
For obsolete Macs, not only will you not get hardware support from Apple, but you also will have issues with the 
software. For example, the latest macOS Big Sur cannot be installed on obsolete products (see 
[macOS Big Sur is compatible with these computers](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211238)). And even if you are not 
planning to use the latest macOS, Application developers may stop support the oldest macOS.

### Where to purchase used Macs?

Obviously anywhere you can find them. Your friends, craigslist, eBay. A bit more expensive options are
[Apple Certified Refurbished](https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished), and more companies sell refurbished Macs.

### What to check when purchasing used Macs?

Verify that the previous owner turned off Find My Mac. Apple has a page for people who are giving away 
or selling their Macs (see [What to do before you sell, give away, or trade-in your Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201065)).
Maybe send this link to the seller to make sure he will do all the steps. Most important for you is to make sure that 
the seller will sign off from iCloud, which will disable the Find My Mac feature.

If you are purchasing a laptop, verify how many cycles are on the battery (see 
[Determine battery cycle count for Mac notebooks](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201585)). This page shows the maximum
cycle count, which can tell you how long you can use this laptop, before you will need to replace the battery. 
An important detail that this page does not tell is that lithium batteries degrade with time, so `100` cycles on the 
battery may reduce `10-20%` of the battery's full capacity (you can use a more user-friendly third-party application, 
like [coconutBattery](https://www.coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or use [`ioreg`](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/240407)).

Sometimes, when you purchase a used Mac, the seller can advertise that it is still covered by an extended 
AppleCare+ warranty. You can check that you will get the serial number of this device on the 
website [Check Your Service and Support Coverage](https://checkcoverage.apple.com). An important detail about that. 
You will need to trust the seller, as even if the AppleCare+ is paid in full, the seller can cancel it anytime.

## What about Hackintosh?

If you are not excited about the Macs but are interested only in macOS, you can kind of build your own mac. 
It is an option. But I am assuming that you know what you are looking for going this route. 
A great resource is [https://hackintosh.com](https://hackintosh.com).

## Laptop or Desktop?

That should be easy to decide. Do you want to carry your Mac with you? Taking it vacations, traveling, or maybe just 
getting it in the backyard and continue working outdoors? The answer is definitely a Laptop.

The reasons to purchase a Desktop are:

- **Mac Mini**, if you are looking for the cheapest Mac (`$700`). A funny thing does not mean the least performant. 
  The latest M1 Chip has a great performance, comparable to most high-end Intel Chips. It is a great option if you 
  already have a monitor or planning to purchase one, to have it as a stationary Mac. It can be a great option to 
  build your own Media Center or local server. You can also use it with an external GPU to get more Graphics 
  performance to do more heavy graphics, video work, and play games.
  
- **iMac**. It is a nice Desktop, where all the components are embedded into one unit, including the monitor. 
  I personally don't recommend it. I had a few, and I found it easy to sell them. So you need to be sure that 
  you are planning to use it for a while. There are definitely some benefits to using it over Mac Mini, 
  considering that you will have fewer wires with all components embedded into one.

- **iMac Pro** and **Mac Pro**. If you are going into these categories, I believe you already know what you are doing.

I will compare the different laptops below.

## Gaming on Mac

There are a lot of games available for Mac. I am not a heavy gamer. But I always suggest heavy gamers considering 
buying a Windows Laptop or PC. But let's say you have decided to play games on Mac.

- **Native games**. If you are not looking for specific games, there are many games with native support for Mac, 
  available on Apple Store and Steam.

- **Gaming in Windows Guest Virtual Machine**. You can use Parallels or VMWare to install Windows as a Guest in 
  Virtual Machine, but you will not get full graphics performance for Virtual Machine. You can still play some 
  old but good games, like Titan Quest. This option available only for Intel-based Macs. Support for Apple Silicon 
  is in Preview. On Apple Silicon, you can only run Windows ARM (which means not all applications are available for 
  this Windows version).
  
- **Gaming in [Bootcamp](https://support.apple.com/boot-camp)**. Available only for Intel-based Macs 
  (no support for Apple Silicon). Depends on the 
  Graphics card, or if an external GPU is supported, you can actually play a lot of AAA games. Again, it will 
  be way easier to play on Windows Laptop or PC. There are always problems with compatibility. You need a specific 
  version of drivers, compatible eGPU, compatible monitor with eGPU.
  
- **Cloud Gaming**. This is a great option to play on Macs. You can use 
  [Google Stadia](https://stadia.com/link/referrals?si_rid=2261358621061005807&si_rt=1) (*a referral link, with an
  additional month of Stadia Pro*) to play many AAA games, including DOOM, DOOM Eternal, Cyberpunk 2077, and more.
  But the list of games is minimal, comparing to what you can get from Steam.

## eGPU

I mentioned above an option to use eGPU to increase graphics performance. Apple sells third-party eGPU in 
[their store](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HM8Y2VC/A/blackmagic-egpu). 
I have used one for Intel-based Mac Mini with LG UltraFine 5k Monitor. BootCamp does not have the best support for eGPU, 
but many users have found some configurations that worked for them.

I would highly recommend looking at the Apple page 
[Use an external graphics processor with your Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208544) 
and website [eGPU](https://egpu.io) to do some research. My suggestion, try to get a Mac with a Graphics 
card that satisfies your needs.


## Apple Silicon (M1) or Intel CPU (and which one)

This is getting interesting. In 2020 Apple introduced a new CPU Chip for Macs - Apple Silicon ([M1](https://www.apple.com/mac/m1/)). If you are not 
tech-savvy, think about switching from a Gasoline car to an Electric car, you still driving a car, but there 
are some pros and cons. The electric car is a future, but we still have improvements to do to make it available 
for all people.

For most people, Macs with Apple Silicon is the best option. It uses less power, which means longer battery life (**significantly**)
and less heating, providing the same performance and sometimes even better. I have MacBook Pro with Intel and M1 
and use 90% time my MacBook Pro with M1. But some things don't work.

Let's just eliminate the reasons why you should not consider purchasing Mac with Apple Silicon (M1):

- You want a laptop with a larger screen (16"). Currently, only Mac Mini, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro 13" 
  available with Apple Silicon.
  
- You are using some software that you cannot run on Mac. You can verify the list of the software at 
  [Is Apple silicon ready?](https://isapplesiliconready.com).
  
- You need to run Windows. Currently, Parallels is available in Preview. You can only install Windows ARM (preview), 
  which cannot run all the Windows software. It is a very high chance that it will not run your specific 
  software on this version of Windows.

- If you are still thinking about playing a lot of games on Mac. BootCamp is not available. Native games and 
  [Google Stadia](https://stadia.com/link/referrals?si_rid=2261358621061005807&si_rt=1) (Cloud Gaming) are 
  still great options.
  
- You are a developer and have specific needs to test on x64 CPU, or you need to run a lot of Virtual Machines on your
  Mac. If you are, I am sure you know which Mac you need.

I will answer some questions about if it is ok to purchase a Mac with Apple Silicon:

- You plan to use Mac for Video, Audio, Photo editing, and Office apps. All of that available for Mac with Apple Silicon.
  
- You are a software developer. At first, let me mention that your company probably provides you a Mac if you are doing 
  it professionally. They decide when it is time to switch to Apple Silicon. If you are an Indie developer or a 
  contractor, developing for Web, backend, iOS, and macOS, many tools are catching up. JetBrains IntelliJ has 
  native support for Apple Silicon. Docker is in preview, and you can run a lot of images in ARM64 architecture 
  (a lot of others in emulation). Building Android applications will probably require using a device, as 
  Android Emulator is in preview and has many 
  [Known Issues](https://androidstudio.googleblog.com/2020/12/android-emulator-apple-silicon-preview.html).
  
### Which Intel CPU to Choose

The cheapest Intel will probably do the work. If you have money, it is good to upgrade to a CPU with the highest numbers 
of cores. As for small upgrades on GHz, you can check [Mac Benchmarks](https://browser.geekbench.com/mac-benchmarks).

So why do you need more CPU cores? If you are running many tasks in parallel, or the software you use supports 
processing tasks on multi-core, the higher number of CPU cores will require less time to complete the task. If 
you are using Office Apps and browsing the Internet, you probably don't need this upgrade. If you are developing 
Web Sites, probably you don't need this update. If you are developing Web Sites, and running many background servers 
in containers and Virtual Machines, you might need a higher number of CPUs. If you are processing videos, RAW photos, 
compiling software that takes minutes, you will benefit from the higher number of CPU cores.

But be careful with purchasing the most expensive CPU for laptops. They might have the highest GHz and the highest 
number of CPU cores, but at the same time, they might be throttled more often because of the overheat. This means 
that they might perform slower in some long-running tasks.

### Which GPU to Choose with Intel-based Mac

If you have decided to purchase an Intel Mac, you will have to choose a discrete GPU Graphics Card in some cases. 
You might want to upgrade to a more performant GPU with more memory if you are a Video Editor (**Professionally**), 
working a lot with RAW Photos (**Professionally**), and still planning to try to play some AAA games on Mac.

## MacBook Air or MacBook Pro 13"

I am talking only about Apple Silicon Macs here. For Intel-based read comparison of MacBook Pro 13" and MacBook Pro 16".

If you are looking at purchasing Apple Silicon MacBook, the difference between MacBook Air and MacBook Pro is not 
that significant. MacBook Pro has TouchBar (not many people use it), has fans (is not required that often with Apple 
Silicon), slightly better battery life, and has a better Display. That all adds an additional cost of $250-$300.

If you can afford it, go with MacBook Pro 13" Apple Silicon.

## MacBook Pro 13" or MacBook Pro 16"

You should consider MacBook Pro 16" only if you specifically need an Intel-based Mac (see above if you need it), with a 
lot of RAM for running Virtual Machines, or if you need a laptop with a larger screen.

Performance of MacBook Pro 13" with Apple Silicon for most of the tasks is comparable to the MacBook Pro 16" with 
the most expensive Intel CPU.

## How much Memory (RAM) do you need? 8Gb, 16Gb, 32Gb...

When we talk between 8Gb, 16Gb, or 32Gb, I would suggest getting the maximum amount. Unfortunately, after you decide 
on the memory, it is impossible to upgrade your Mac to include more Memory. And that is the main reason why you should 
get the maximum. If we are talking about 32Gb and more, you probably know how much memory you need.

If you don't have a budget to purchase more memory and end up with 16Gb instead of 8Gb, is that bad? Not really. 
Does it mean you will not be able to open many documents on your Mac, with a lot of Tabs in the browser? Not at all. 
That means that you more likely will find things to be slower or impossible to perform when you try to render a Video, 
Watch a Movie, and work on a RAW Photo at the same time.

Remember, I mentioned the speed of different types of Disks? All Mac Disks currently are shipping with NVMe SSD 
(with 2-5Gb/s read speed), Memory (RAM) has speeds of 15-30Gb/s (10 times faster). CPU does not work with the data 
on Disk. It requires Mac to load it in Memory (RAM).

Let me provide you an example. This is an elementary example. I would not use it as a reference in your Ph.D. thesis. 
You got a MacBook with 8Gb of Memory (RAM). You open 16 Tabs with Web Pages in your browser, and each 
Tab consumes 0.5Gb of Memory. You have enough Memory to support it (16 * 0.5Gb equal to 8Gb). What if you need 
to open another Page in the Browser? You only have 8Gb of Memory, which is not enough to open one more. This means 
that the Browser and Mac will have to decide how to provide a memory for a new Page:

- One way is to cache some previous Tabs (Web Pages) on Disk (this is called a Swap memory), releasing the RAM Memory, 
  allowing CPU to work with new Page. If you switch back to the Tab that was cached on Disk, Mac will need to cache
  another Tab on Disk and load the one you need from the Disk back to Memory. We know that our Disk provides 2Gb/s 
  speed at least, so saving and loading 0.5Gb will take it around half of a second. Will you notice that? Probably not. 
  In a real scenario, pages will be way smaller, the data will be compressed, which means taking less Memory space, 
  so these delays will be shorter.
  
- The second option is to completely reload the page from memory, only keeping the URL referencing the page. 
  So when you come back to this page, the browser will reload the page. That probably will be easier to notice, 
  depends on how fast your Internet is and how patient you are.
  
But if you will work on several applications simultaneously, let's say you will be editing RAW Photo, and switching 
to a Video Editor of 60 minutes movie you are creating, both of them can require a significant amount of memory (RAM),
maybe 16Gb each, which means that delays of switching between applications can be way more noticeable. But again, 
we are talking about Professional work.

Editing Office documents do not require a lot of Memory. A single Web Page in the Browser does not require a lot of 
memory. Working in an editor or IDE on a software project does not require a lot of memory. Developing complex 
software with multiple components, like a Database, Docker containers, multiple Servers, all working simultaneously, 
might require more memory. Still, we are talking about developing large scalable systems working with a lot of data, 
not a backend website for your Indie Project.

## How much Storage do you need? 256Gb, 512Gb, 1Tb...
